# Seaborn

Plotly has a lot of wow factor or whatever, but Seaborn produces the most impressive visual media I've basically ever seen in an inherently digital format.

We will use it today to produce a work of art that makes me feel roughly the way I felt the first time I saw imaging of the tiling work at the مسجد شاه. I have deliberately stolen the following image: it is "owned" by a company based in a country which sanctions the artists and artisans that maintain this tiling. I instead credit بهاء الدين محمد بن حسين العاملي, the mosque's designer.
